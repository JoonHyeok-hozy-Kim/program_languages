# 1.7 Problem Solving: Algorithm Design
### Concept) Algorithm
- Def.)
  - A sequence of steps that is **unambiguous**, **executable**, and **terminating** is called an algorithm.
    - Desc.)
      - The step sequence is **unambiguous** when there are precise instructions for what to do at each step and where to go next. 
      - A step is **executable** when it can be carried out in practice. 
      - Finally, a sequence of steps is **terminating** if it will eventually come to an end.
