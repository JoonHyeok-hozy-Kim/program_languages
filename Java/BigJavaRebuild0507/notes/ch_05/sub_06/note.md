# 5.6 Problem Solving: Selecting Test Cases
### Concept) Black-Box Testing
- Testing the functionality of a program without consideration of its internal structure

<br>

### Concept) White-Box Testing
- Testing strategies that look inside a program

<br>

### Concept) Code Coverage
- Each part of your program is exercised at least once by one of your test cases.

<br>

### Tech) Logging in Java
- Use ```Logger.getGlobal()```.
- e.g.)
  ```java
  Logger.getGlobal().setLevel(Level.OFF);   // This command is required to show all the logs.
  Logger.getGlobal().info("status is SINGLE");
  ```
